    {
      "question": "What did you observe when exploiting a format string vulnerability in the simulation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The program displayed the user input correctly without any issues.",
        "b": "The program crashed immediately upon entering the format string attack.",
        "c": "The format string attack allowed access to secret values stored in memory.",
        "d": "The program encrypted the sensitive data automatically."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This indicates no vulnerability was present or exploited.",
        "b": "While crashing can occur, it is not the primary observation for format string attacks.",
        "c": "Correct. Exploiting the format string vulnerability allowed access to secret values or sensitive data in memory.",
        "d": "Encryption is not a result of format string vulnerabilities; rather, they expose data."

      "correctAnswer": "c",

    {
      "question": "Which coding practice can help prevent format string vulnerabilities?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Directly using user input as a format string in printf functions.",
        "b": "Validating and sanitizing user input before using it in format strings.",
        "c": "Avoiding the use of format strings altogether.",
        "d": "Using encryption on all user inputs."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Directly using user input without validation is what causes the vulnerability.",
        "b": "Correct. Proper validation and sanitization of user input prevent format string vulnerabilities.",
        "c": "While avoiding format strings can help, it is not always practical or necessary; proper validation is preferred.",
        "d": "Encryption is not directly related to preventing format string vulnerabilities."

      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"

    {
      "question": "What is the primary risk associated with a format string vulnerability if exploited by an attacker?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Loss of network connectivity",
        "b": "Exposure of sensitive data or potential unauthorized code execution",
        "c": "Data loss due to file corruption",
        "d": "Increased application performance"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Format string vulnerabilities do not typically affect network connectivity.",
        "b": "Correct. The primary risk is exposure of sensitive data or unauthorized code execution.",
        "c": "While format string vulnerabilities can cause various issues, data loss due to file corruption is not a typical risk.",
        "d": "Format string vulnerabilities do not improve application performance; they pose security risks."
      },
