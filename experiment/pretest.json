    {
      "question": "What is a format string vulnerability?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A type of vulnerability where user input is incorrectly formatted for display.",
        "b": "A security flaw where user input is used as a format string in functions like printf, potentially allowing unauthorized access to memory.",
        "c": "A vulnerability that occurs when a program fails to encrypt data properly.",
        "d": "A bug that results in incorrect data being sent over a network."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This describes a symptom of the issue, not the actual vulnerability.",
        "b": "Correct. Format string vulnerabilities occur when user input is used directly as a format string, potentially exposing memory or allowing for other attacks.",
        "c": "This describes a different type of security issue related to encryption, not format strings.",
        "d": "This describes a network-related issue rather than a format string vulnerability."

    {
      "question": "Which function is commonly associated with format string vulnerabilities?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "scanf",
        "b": "strcpy",
        "c": "printf",
        "d": "fopen"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "While `scanf` can have its own issues, it is not typically associated with format string vulnerabilities in the same way as `printf`.",
        "b": "`strcpy` is used for copying strings and is not related to format string vulnerabilities.",
        "c": "Correct. `printf` is commonly associated with format string vulnerabilities when user input is improperly used as a format string.",
        "d": "`fopen` is related to file operations and does not involve format string issues."

    {
      "question": "What can be a consequence of exploiting a format string vulnerability?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The application might crash or behave unexpectedly.",
        "b": "Sensitive data may be exposed from memory.",
        "c": "Unauthorized code execution may occur.",
        "d": "All of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "While application crashes are possible, there are often more serious consequences.",
        "b": "Correct. Exploiting a format string vulnerability can lead to exposure of sensitive data stored in memory.",
        "c": "Correct. Exploiting such vulnerabilities can also lead to unauthorized code execution.",
        "d": "Correct. All of the listed consequences can result from exploiting a format string vulnerability."
